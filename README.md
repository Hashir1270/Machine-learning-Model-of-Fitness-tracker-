Exercise Tracking Model: Predicting Exercises and Rep Counting with Sensor Data
This repository presents a machine learning model for real-time exercise tracking using sensor data from devices like smartwatches or fitness trackers. The model analyzes accelerometer and gyroscope data to:

Predict the type of exercise performed: Accurately identify various exercises with multi-class classification.
Count repetitions: Track the number of repetitions for each exercise, providing valuable workout insights.
Key features:

Data processing: Handles raw sensor data, pre-processes it for efficient analysis, and removes noise for improved accuracy.
Data visualization: Provides various visualizations to explore the sensor data and understand the model's behavior.
Outlier detection: Identifies and handles outliers in the sensor data to ensure robust model performance.
Feature engineering: Applies low-pass filters to extract meaningful features from the raw data and prepare it for the neural network.
Neural network prediction: Utilizes a neural network architecture to learn the complex relationships between sensor data and exercise patterns.
Repetition counting: Employs dedicated algorithms to accurately count repetitions for each identified exercise.
Benefits:

Improved workout tracking: Gain deeper insights into your workouts with accurate exercise identification and rep counting.
Personalized fitness programs: Utilize the model's capabilities to develop personalized fitness routines based on your preferences and performance.
Enhanced user experience: Integrate the model into fitness applications to provide real-time feedback and motivation during workouts.
